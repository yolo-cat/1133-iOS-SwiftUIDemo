# UI framework rules for SwiftUI

1. State Management:
   - Use `@Observable` for reference types holding business logic and app state.  
   - Use `@Bindable` properties within @Observable classes so SwiftUI views can bind directly to them.
   - Avoid `@State` for view model observation, rely on `let model: MyModel` instead.  
   - Pass dependencies via initialisers rather than as global singletons.  
   - Use `@Environment` for app-wide or large-scope states.  
   - `@State` is only for view-local state.
   - Use `@Binding` only if necessary
   - Prevent using `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, `@Published`, `ObservableObject`, `@EnvironmentObject`

2. Modern Navigation:
   - Use `NavigationSplitView` for multi-column layouts on larger displays.  
   - Use `NavigationStack` with type-safe navigation for simpler or single-column apps.  
   - Use `navigationDestination()` for programmatic navigation and deep linking.

3. Layout System:
   - Use `Grid` for complex, flexible layouts.  
   - `ViewThatFits` for adaptive interfaces.  
   - Custom layouts via the `Layout` protocol.  
   - Apply `containerRelativeFrame()` for responsive sizing and positioning.  
   - Ensure Dynamic Type support in text and layouts.

4. Performance:
   - Annotate UI-updating code paths with `@MainActor`.  
   - Use `TaskGroup` for concurrent operations.  
   - Implement lazy loading (`LazyVStack`, `LazyHGrid`) with stable, identifiable items to boost performance.

5. UI Components:
   - Use `ScrollView` with `.scrollTargetBehavior()` for a better scrolling experience.  
   - Employ `.contentMargins()` for consistent internal spacing.  
   - Apply `.containerShape()` to customise hit testing areas.  
   - Use SF Symbols 5 with variable-colour and variable-width glyphs where appropriate.  
   - Extract reusable functionality into custom `ViewModifiers`.

6. Interaction & Animation:
   - Trigger visual changes with `.animation(value:)`.  
   - Use Phase Animations for more complex transitions.  
   - Leverage `.symbolEffect()` for SF Symbol animations.  
   - Include `.sensoryFeedback()` for haptic or audio cues.  
   - Utilise SwiftUI’s gesture system for touch interactions.

7. Accessibility:
   - Every UI element must have an appropriate `.accessibilityLabel()`, `.accessibilityHint()`, and traits.  
   - Support VoiceOver by making sure views are `.accessibilityElement()` where needed.  
   - Implement Dynamic Type and test with larger text sizes.  
   - Provide clear, descriptive accessibility text for all elements.  
   - Respect reduced motion settings and provide alternatives if needed.

8. Reserved words
   - Prevent using `Task` as type name in favor of Swift Concurrency
   - Prevent import `@_exported` and `@_spi`
   - Prevent `import UIKit`
